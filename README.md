Code for handling output from the TDS AUTO LOG PROGRAM Version 2.00 3-97 (TDS 410A, TDS 420A & TDS 460A Digitizing Oscilloscopes). Designed to be run in the CERN ROOT interpreter. Reads both ASCII and binary files by specifying either a dat, bin, or hdr file as the last command line argument, and creates ROOT files containing histograms of the traces from each scope channel.
